    // Permission grants are per-(owner, peer) so a brain can have hundreds
    // of peers with completely different visibility rules without the rule
    // engine having to scan unrelated records. Storage is local-first:
    // even on MySQL deployments, scope ownership is tied to the OWNER's
    // brain address — the hub never persists scopes that don't belong to
    // the caller. Default for any (owner, peer) pair that has no record is
    // "deny everything" — never store an implicit allow.
    //
    // Default impls return empty / no-op so legacy storage providers don't
    // break the build during Phase 1 rollout.
