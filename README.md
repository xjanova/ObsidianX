## See it in motion

> **Dashboard — 3D mode**, with the glassmorphism Expertise Profile overlay floating on top of a live force-directed graph. Each node is a Markdown note; each edge is a `[[wiki-link]]` or an auto-detected semantic relation. Translucent cluster bubbles wear a colored equator ring for their dominant category, so the brain's regions read at a glance.

![Dashboard 3D](docs/screenshots/dashboard-3d.png)

> **Same data, 2D mode** — one click from the toolbar swaps to a `DrawingContext`-based renderer that handles thousands of nodes without breaking a sweat. Nodes are colored by `KnowledgeCategory`, so Programming nodes are cyan, Design is pink, Engineering is green, etc. Pan with drag, zoom with wheel.

![Dashboard 2D](docs/screenshots/dashboard-2d.png)

> **Knowledge Growth** — a real time-series of when notes were actually written, not a snapshot. The pink line is the cumulative total; thinner lines split out the top expertise categories. The vertical staircase reveals "burst learning" days vs slow weeks.

![Knowledge Growth](docs/screenshots/growth-chart.png)

> **AI Brain Assistant** — pick a backend (local Ollama or one of 130+ cloud models from NVIDIA NIM, OpenRouter, DeepSeek), ask anything. The vault is the system prompt. Optional **traffic redirect** quietly forwards Claude Desktop calls to a local model so your private brain never leaves your machine.

## What is ObsidianX?

ObsidianX is a **complete Obsidian replacement** that turns a Markdown vault into:

- a **living 3D brain** you can rotate, zoom, and dive into
- a **2D fallback** that's blazingly fast at any node count
- a **MCP server** that hands the vault to Claude Desktop and Claude Code as a first-class tool surface
- a **137-model AI Hub** local + cloud, with one-click model swap
- a **peer-to-peer mesh** where brains find each other by expertise and share knowledge under consent
- an **auto-healing process tree**: open Claude → MCP starts → Client launches → Server boots → all green, all the time

Three processes, one chain:

```
Claude Desktop ──spawns──► obsidianx-mcp ──spawns──► ObsidianX.Client ──spawns──► ObsidianX.Server
                              (stdio MCP)              (WPF, 3D + 2D)              (Kestrel :5142)
                                                                                          │
                                                                                          └─ AI Hub: Ollama + NVIDIA NIM
                                                                                             + OpenRouter + DeepSeek
```

## What's new

### Visualization & UX
- 🪟 **Glassmorphism overlay** for the Expertise Profile — frosted-glass card sitting on top of the map, scrollable when categories grow
- 🎚️ **3D ↔ 2D toggle** on both the Dashboard map and the full Brain Graph view; 2D path uses retained-mode `DrawingContext` and stays smooth at 1000+ nodes
- 🎯 **Fit-to-view camera** on first load — bounding-sphere math frames the whole graph instead of opening on a zoomed-in slice
- 🖱️ **Hover-scoped wheel zoom** — wheel only zooms when the cursor is over the map, dashboard scroll is unaffected
- 🔵 **Translucent cluster bubbles** with **category-colored equator rings** — clicks land on nodes inside, the bubble is a hint not a wall
- 🎨 **Categorical 2D coloring** — every node colored by its `KnowledgeCategory`, you can read the brain's regions at a glance

### Knowledge & charts
- 📈 **Knowledge Growth as a real time-series** — cumulative line chart over actual `CreatedAt` dates, with per-category sub-lines and locale-aware date axis
- 🧮 **Honest expertise scoring** — relative-to-max ranking instead of the previous `min(1, sum/10)` clamp that pinned everything to 100%
- 🪶 **Self-healing CLAUDE.md** — auto-managed `<!-- BRAIN:BEGIN/END -->` section keeps stats fresh on every export, never bloats the file
- 🧠 **Real Brain camera mode** — lifecycle-aware attention scoring (birth / edit / death events steer the camera in addition to MCP access pulses)

### Services & install
- 🫥 **Server runs hidden** — no console window, drained stdout/stderr, surfaced through a click-to-open status chip in the status bar
- 🔁 **Auto-launch chain** — MCP launches the Client by newest-mtime; Client launches the Server by newest-mtime; everything self-spawns when Claude opens
- 🚀 **WPAD-free HttpClient** — every localhost call disables proxy auto-detect, eliminating 5-10 second timeouts on first paint
- 🔧 **Self-installing Claude memory rules** — on first run, the Client seeds `~/.claude/projects/<vault>/memory/` with the project's brain-save policy, with a version field so future Client builds upgrade transparently
- 🖥️ **Multi-resolution icon + auto-shortcut** — first launch creates a Desktop shortcut pointing at the freshest build, self-heals if the build folder moves

### MCP & AI
- 🛰️ **MCP server** (stdio) ships brain tools to Claude: `brain_search`, `brain_create_note`, `brain_append_note`, `brain_remember`, `brain_expertise`, `brain_list`, `brain_stats`, `brain_get_note`, `brain_import_path`
- 🪵 **Auto-journal** — every MCP tool call lands in `.obsidianx/sessions/<date>.md`, so Claude can review what it did without you asking
- 🌐 **AI Hub** — single API surface over Ollama (local) + NVIDIA NIM (free tier, Llama 4 / GPT-OSS / DeepSeek / Qwen / Gemma) + OpenRouter + DeepSeek; backend + model picker + per-router stats
- 🪞 **Claude redirect mode** — toggle Claude Desktop traffic to a local model with full visibility of in/out bytes and request count

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Core targets .NET 9; Client + Server target .NET 10)
- Windows 10/11 (WPF requirement)
- Optional: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for fully local AI; an NVIDIA NIM / OpenRouter / DeepSeek key for cloud models

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xjanova/ObsidianX.git
cd ObsidianX
dotnet build ObsidianX.slnx -c Release
```

That's it for setup. Now run **just the Client**:

```bash
cd ObsidianX.Client
dotnet run -- "C:\path\to\your\markdown\vault"
```

The Client will:
1. Auto-create a Desktop shortcut pointing at the freshest build
2. Seed `~/.claude/projects/<vault>/memory/` with the brain-save policy
3. Detect that the Server isn't running and **launch it hidden**
4. Detect that AI backends are reachable and populate the model dropdown

To use the brain from Claude Desktop, register the MCP server in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidianx-brain": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\ObsidianX\\ObsidianX.Mcp\\bin\\Release\\net9.0\\obsidianx-mcp.exe",
      "args": [],
      "env": { "OBSIDIANX_VAULT": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\vault" }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and the chain wires itself up — MCP → Client → Server, all visible in the Client's status bar chips.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+S` | Save current note |
| `Ctrl+O` | Quick switcher |
| `Ctrl+N` | Create new note |
| `Ctrl+B` / `Ctrl+I` | Bold / Italic |
| `Ctrl+K` | Insert wiki-link |
| `Ctrl+F` | Find in editor |
| `Ctrl+Click` | Follow wiki-link |
| `Drag` on map | Rotate (3D) / Pan (2D) |
| `Wheel` over map | Zoom (event consumed, doesn't scroll page) |
| `Right-click` on node | Kick the physics for fun |

## Security & privacy

- **ECDSA signatures** for brain identity and knowledge authenticity
- **Input validation** on every SignalR hub method
- **XSS-safe** server dashboard (HTML-escaped output)
- **Local-first by default** — your brain stays on your disk; cloud AI keys are stored locally in `.obsidianx/ai-keys.json` and never leave your machine
- **Consent-gated sharing** — peers must accept share requests; data transfer is opt-in per-note
- **Claude redirect** lets you transparently route Claude Desktop traffic to a local model
- **No command injection** — all CLI invocations use `ArgumentList`
- **Hidden background services** without sneakiness — every running piece is reported in the status bar

## Roadmap

- [ ] Encrypted P2P content transfer (consent → keypair exchange → blob)
- [ ] Multi-vault support
- [ ] Plugin system for custom categorizers
- [ ] Voice-to-knowledge (audio note capture + transcription)
- [ ] Mobile companion (read-only)
- [ ] Decentralized server discovery (DHT)
- [ ] Real-time co-authoring on shared nodes
- [ ] Image / attachment support in editor
- [ ] User-defined themes
- [ ] Per-note ACL with selective sharing

The codebase is heavily commented — every non-trivial design choice has a paragraph explaining *why*. Look for those when you're trying to understand the intent. The brain itself (in `Programming/CSharp/`, `Programming/WPF/`) keeps a growing collection of "lessons learned" notes that double as architecture rationale.
