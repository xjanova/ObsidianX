# Deploy the rebuilt MCP DLL after restarting Claude Code.
#
# Why this script: Claude Code spawns one obsidianx-mcp.exe per session and
# holds the DLL open for the lifetime of that session. Building over a live
# DLL fails with MSB3027. The new build lives at bin/TestBuild/ -- this
# script swaps it into bin/Release/ once no MCP process is alive.
#
# IMPORTANT: this file MUST be saved as UTF-8 WITHOUT BOM and ASCII-only,
# because Windows PowerShell 5.1 silently mis-decodes UTF-8 multibyte
# characters (em-dash, checkmark, etc.) and trips the parser before
# any line of the script runs. Keep punctuation in this file ASCII.
